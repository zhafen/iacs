"""Mechanical safety checks for a raw entity-first YAML write, run before
merging it into a registry.

Ported from story-simulator's own story_simulator/core.py, which found
these are the exact failure modes a weak LLM actually hits composing
entity-first YAML by hand -- see that repo's docs/manifest/history.yaml
for the specific incidents each check targets
(nested_component_name_collision_check_added,
mechanical_component_type_validation_added). Generalized here since
nothing about them is story-simulator-specific: pure functions over
already-parsed YAML plus a registry's own known component types. The
third check this session's write tools also run --
`_find_malformed_entities`, the bare-mapping check -- already lives
natively in `iacs.dataflows.etl.load_yaml` and runs automatically inside
`Registrar.update()`'s own ETL, so it isn't duplicated here.

    a nested child entity's own alias). The parser reads this shape as
    "car_b has a nested child entity named `location`", not "attach a
    `location` component to car_b" -- structurally identical to a genuine
    nested entity, so the bare-mapping check can't catch it on shape
    alone.

    Mechanical, not semantic, like `find_unknown_component_types`: a
    nested child entity's alias coinciding with a real component type's
    name is vanishingly unlikely to be intentional, so this flags every
    such collision.

    Only checks nesting one level below a top-level alias, matching the
    one live mistake actually observed -- not a general recursive walk,
