    Tries three resolutions in order, from most to least exact, each one
    a fallback for when the previous finds nothing:

    1. An exact match against `value` (the entity_id hash itself) —
       `user_path` is returned unchanged as the sole candidate if it's
       already a valid entity_id. Lets any `entity_ref`-typed field (or
       `same_as.value`) reference an entity precisely by hash, the same
       as `same_as.target_entity_id` does explicitly, without a caller
       needing that separate field.
    2. An exact match against `alias`, when `entity_id_table` has one
       (every real entity_id table does; callers that pass a bare
       `value`/`path` table — e.g. the older, alias-less tests for this
       function — just skip to the substring fallback). This isn't just
       an optimization: a container entity's own alias is always a
       substring of its descendants' full paths too (e.g.
       `"make_cats_happy"` vs. `"make_cats_happy.feed_and_water_cats"`),
       so without it, `user_path` naming a container by its own alias
       would resolve as ambiguous with its own children instead of
       uniquely to the container.
    3. Every entity ID whose full `path` contains `user_path` as a
       substring.
